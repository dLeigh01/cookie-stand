### Reflections 01

Objects are very interesting. I had a few issues during this lab, not even specifically attributed to objects as a whole, but it was harder to fix them since I was working with so many layers at a time. I had an issue with my number generator that had me restructuring a pretty major portion of my object with a TA to make it actually run the function, which was interesting. Other than that, most of the time spent on this just went into glancing back and forth between the demo and my code trying to get an understanding of how writing to the DOM works.
